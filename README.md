## What optimizerDuck Does & Why It Matters

Windows works great out of the box. However, a fresh installation also includes background services, telemetry, pre-installed apps, and scheduled tasks that continue running even if you never use them. These consume system resources such as CPU, RAM, disk, and network in the background.

At the same time, many settings that can improve performance, reduce latency, or provide a smoother experience are not enabled by default.

optimizerDuck brings everything together in one place. It helps you optimize Windows, remove unnecessary components, customize system settings, and manage common Windows features without digging through the Registry, Group Policy, or PowerShell.

It also includes built-in management tools, allowing you to see what is running, remove what you don't need, and restore changes whenever necessary.

### System Optimizations

Over 30 tweaks across 6 categories, each with a clear description and risk rating so you know exactly what each change does before applying it.

| Category                 | What it covers                                                                                                                                       |

### Why optimize Windows instead of just upgrading your hardware?

The fastest way to improve performance is always upgrading your hardware. A better CPU, GPU, more RAM, or a faster SSD will usually provide much larger improvements than software tweaks alone.

But hardware is only one part of the picture.

Windows is designed for hundreds of millions of PCs with different hardware, workloads, and users. Because of that, Microsoft ships Windows with settings that prioritize compatibility, stability, battery life, and ease of use instead of maximum performance.

As a result, a default Windows installation includes many background services, scheduled tasks, telemetry, power-saving features, and pre-installed apps that many users may never need.

This is especially true after reinstalling Windows. Even after installing all drivers and updates, many useful performance-related settings remain untouched, while unnecessary background components continue running.

Optimizing Windows is simply about reducing unnecessary overhead so your PC can spend more of its resources on what actually matters, whether that's gaming, programming, content creation, or everyday work.

It won't magically double your FPS, but it can reduce background activity, lower system latency, improve responsiveness, and help your hardware perform more consistently.

This is also one reason why many people recommend Linux for better performance and lower system overhead. If you prefer staying on Windows for its software compatibility and familiar experience, optimizerDuck helps you get the best possible experience without switching operating systems.

### When should I optimize Windows?

The best time is **after setting up a fresh Windows installation**.

We recommend this order:

1. Install Windows.
2. Install all hardware drivers (chipset, GPU, network, audio, etc.).
3. Run **Windows Update** until no more updates are available.
4. Install all **Optional Updates**.
5. Open the **Microsoft Store** and update all built-in applications.
6. Install the software and games you normally use.
7. Apply your preferred optimizerDuck optimizations.
8. Use optimizerDuck's built-in tools to remove unnecessary apps, clean up Windows, and manage startup programs.

Following this order helps avoid Windows or driver updates overwriting your optimizations later.

> [!TIP]
> Many advanced users choose to temporarily disable automatic Windows Updates after finishing their setup. Large Windows updates may restore default settings, reinstall certain components, or undo some optimizations. If you do this, remember to periodically enable Windows Update again to install important security updates before disabling it again.

> [!NOTE]
> Every optimization provided by optimizerDuck can also be performed manually. The goal of optimizerDuck is simply to make Windows optimization easier, safer, and more convenient.

## Safety

Changing system settings carries risk. optimizerDuck is built around reversibility and user control.

- **Automatic backups**: Every change writes a revert file to a local folder. You can restore individual tweaks or roll back everything
- **One-click revert**: Undo any applied optimization from the UI with a single click
- **Risk ratings**: Each tweak is labeled Safe, Moderate, or Risky based on its potential impact
- **No defaults applied**: Nothing runs until you select it. The tool does not enable anything on its own
- **Restore point prompt**: Before your first optimization, the app suggests creating a Windows restore point

---

## FAQ

### Is optimizerDuck safe to use?

Yes. optimizerDuck is fully **open-source** (GPL v3), meaning anyone can inspect, audit, or build the source code themselves. Every release is built automatically by **GitHub Actions** from the public source; no hidden modifications, no unsigned binaries injected after build. If you prefer, you can clone the repo and build the `.exe` yourself with a single `dotnet build`.

The app does **not** collect any telemetry, usage data, or personal information.

### Does optimizerDuck actually improve performance, reduce latency, or speed up my network?

It can help. Every optimization in optimizerDuck is **researched from well-known tools, community guides, and hardware vendor recommendations**, nothing is AI-generated, blindly added, or made up. Each tweak addresses a real setting that Windows configures conservatively by default (e.g., service host grouping, GPU power states, network throttling, process scheduling).

There are no fake registry hacks here, every change has a documented purpose and real-world impact backed by community testing and vendor documentation.

### Why does Windows SmartScreen / Defender flag the download?

optimizerDuck is not code-signed because code signing certificates are expensive for open-source projects. When Windows encounters an unsigned executable downloaded from the internet, SmartScreen displays a warning by default. This is normal and does **not** mean the file is unsafe.

To bypass, click **"More info" > "Run anyway"**.

### Can I revert changes if something goes wrong?

Yes. Every optimization creates a revert file before applying. You can undo individual tweaks or roll back everything from the UI with one click. The app also suggests creating a Windows System Restore point before your first optimization.

### Does this work on Windows 10 and Windows 11?

Yes. optimizerDuck supports **Windows 10 (x64)** and **Windows 11 (x64)**.

### Do I need administrator rights?

Yes. optimizerDuck modifies system settings and the Windows registry, so it requires administrator privileges to run.

### Does optimizerDuck collect my data?

No. The app contains zero telemetry, analytics, or phone-home functionality. It runs entirely offline and does not send any data anywhere.

### Why does Task Manager show 100% CPU after applying the power plan?

A known Task Manager display bug triggered by non-default power plans, it incorrectly reports 100% CPU on some systems while actual load is normal. Visual only, does **not** affect real performance or cause overheating. If unwanted, simply toggle off this optimization.

## Troubleshooting


### The app fails to start or crashes on launch

Make sure you are running as **Administrator**. optimizerDuck requires elevated privileges. If it still crashes, download the latest version from [Releases](../../releases); an outdated build may be incompatible with your Windows version.

### Changes don't seem to take effect after applying

Some optimizations require a **system restart** to apply fully. If a tweak doesn't appear to work after restarting, try applying it again or check the revert section to verify the change was saved.

### Revert file is missing or corrupted

Revert files are stored in `%LocalAppData%\optimizerDuck\Revert\`. If a file is accidentally deleted or corrupted, you can restore it from a backup or create a **System Restore Point** beforehand as a fallback.

### Windows Update resets my settings

Windows feature updates occasionally reset certain registry values and service configurations to defaults. Simply re-apply your previous optimizations from the app after a major update.
